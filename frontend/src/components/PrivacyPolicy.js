          A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer
          or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify the visitor’s

          beacon” is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used
          in combination with cookies, a web beacon is an often transparent
          graphic image, usually no larger than 1-pixel x 1-pixel, that is
          placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the
